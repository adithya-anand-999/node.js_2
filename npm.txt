npm i <packagename> or npm install <packagename> 
This will install the package locally to your current directory, this is used more often the the global variant (which you can do by providing
a -g flag after the install/i) this is due to npx. 

package.json - manifest file that stores important info about project/package. This will list the packages you have installed in your project
directory and the versions of them. 

To create package.json you would normally do npm init (step by step creation of package.json) 
or npm init -y (sets ups package.json with all default values)

node_modules is where all the files for the installed modules go. 



how to delete installed modules?
    npm uninstall <package name>


to install a module as a dev dependency you would do npm i/install <package name> -D/--save-dev
    for example: npm i nodemon -D or npm install nodemon --save-dev
The reason for dev dependency are dependency also used when developing and it is not nessesary once the app is in production. You could
have them in normal dependenices but it would make more sense in dev dependency. 


to run a any of the scripts you would do npm run <scripName>. But if your script name is start, then you can do npm start, but this is only 
for start nothing else.
