npm i <packagename> or npm install <packagename> 
This will install the package locally to your current directory, this is used more often the the global variant (which you can do by providing
a -g flag after the install/i) this is due to npx. 

package.json - manifest file that stores important info about project/package. This will list the packages you have installed in your project
directory and the versions of them. 

To create package.json you would normally do npm init (step by step creation of package.json) 
or npm init -y (sets ups package.json with all default values)

node_modules is where all the files for the installed modules go.
